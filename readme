Projects type :   Machine learning and data analysis 
	1) Prediction of stocks using linear regression.
	2) Linear Regession and coeffient of determination algorithm from scratch and predicting data using it.


Calculation of linear regression: 
Formula : 
	y = mx + b 
	where, 
	m = slope of the line,
	b = y-intercept 
	y = dependent variable ,
	x = independent variable

	Calculation of m = mean(x*y) - (mean(x) * mean(y)) / (mean(x**2) - ((mean(x))**2 ) 
	Calculation of b = mean(y) - (m * mean(x))

Calculation of coefficient of determination : 
	R ^ 2 = 1 - ((Squared error(regression_line)/ Squared_error(y))
	the more the value of R^2 , the more accurate the prediction is
